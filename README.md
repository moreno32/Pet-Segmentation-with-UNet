# Pet Segmentation with UNet

## 🔄 Overview:
This project involves building a semantic image segmentation model using the UNet architecture. This network utilizes skip connections from the encoder to the decoder, which differentiates it from a typical convolutional network. The final output of the model is a segmentation mask that highlights the background, foreground and outline of an input image.

## 🎊 Motivation:
In the field of computer vision, semantic image segmentation is a crucial task with a wide range of real-world applications such as image analysis, object recognition, and autonomous navigation. This project serves as an opportunity to learn and implement UNet architecture, and explore the benefits of using skip connections for semantic image segmentation.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Gain experience with the UNet architecture for semantic image segmentation.
2)	Learn how to implement skip connections in a fully convolutional network.
3)	Train a model to predict segmentation masks from pet images.
4)	Understand the process of preparing and preprocessing the data for training.

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
This project uses the UNet architecture and TensorFlow framework for model training and prediction. Other tools and libraries used include matplotlib, numpy, and the Oxford Pets - IIT dataset for training.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use the Object Detection API, RetinaNet, matplotlib, os, random, zipfile, io, scipy, numpy, glob, imageio, six, PIL, Ipython, and tensorflow.

## 📚 Data Source:
The model will be trained on the Oxford Pets - IIT dataset, which contains pet images, classes, segmentation masks and head region-of-interest.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Imports
2)	Downloading the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset
3)	Preparing the Dataset
4)	Defining the model
5)	Compiling and training the model
6)	Making predictions

## 👥 Credits:
This project was made possible with the support of OpenAI. The team built a semantic image segmentation model using the UNet architecture, incorporating unique skip connections between the encoder and decoder to improve performance. The final model produces high-quality segmentation masks, identifying the background, foreground, and outline of input images with precision.
